### Instructions

Please answer the following questions in the order in which they are posed. Add a few empty lines below each and write your answers there. \textbf{Focus on answering in complete sentences and show work whether we ask for it or not}. You will also need scratch paper/pen to work out the answers before typing it.

### Exercises 

1. The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent, each taking the values 1, 2 or 3. Complete the following table of the joint PMF. Show your work for each entry below the table.


\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|ccc|} \hline
\diagbox{$y$}{$x$} & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
1 & 0.03 & 0.04 & 0.03 \\
2 & 0.15 & (b) & (c) \\
3 & (a) & (d) & (e) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

2. Suppose the probabilistic behavior of $\langle X, Y \rangle$ is governed by the joint PDF
$$f(x,y) = c x^2\: y^4\:e^{-y}\:e^{-\frac{x}{2}} \ \ \ 0 < x, \ 0 < y.$$

a. Determine $c$. Show work.

\emph{Hint: you will need to remember properties of the Gamma function $\Gamma(k)$  which is defined for $k > 0$ as: }
$$\Gamma(k) = \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} x^{k-1} e^{-x} dx$$

b. Are $X$ and $Y$ are independent? Explain.


3. Two friends - let's call them Henry and Vincent - agree to meet at Tully's for coffee. Suppose that the random variables 
$$X =  \mbox{the time that Henry arrives at Tully's and}$$
$$Y = \mbox{the time that Vincent arrives at Tully's}$$
are independent uniform random variables on the interval $[5,6]$. 
(The units are hours after noon)


a. Calculate the probability that both of them arrive before 5:30 PM.

b. If neither of them is willing to wait more than 10 minutes for the other to show up, what is the probability they have a coffee together? That is, what is the probability they arrive within 10 minutes of each other.

\emph{Hint: Here you want to find the probability that $|X-Y|$ is less than some number. }


4. An individual makes 100 check transactions between receiving his December and his January bank
statements. Rather than subtracting the amounts exactly, he rounds off each checkbook entry to the
nearest dollar. Let $X_i$ denote the round off error on the $ith$ check. A reasonable assumption is that 
$$X_i \sim Unif\left(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right)$$
independently of each other.

Use the Bienaym√©-Chebyshev inequality to get an upper bound for the probability that the
accumulated error after his 100 transactions is $5 or more. Show work.
